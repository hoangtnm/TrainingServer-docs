# Installing ZSH


### Zsh?

Oh-My-Zsh is a framework for Zsh, the Z shell.
- In order for Oh-My-Zsh to work, Zsh must be installed.
  * Please run zsh `--version` to confirm.
  * Expected result: `zsh 5.1.1` or more recent
- Additionally, Zsh should be set as your default shell


### How to install zsh in many platforms

#### macOS

Try `zsh --version` before installing it from Homebrew. If it's newer than 4.3.9 you might be OK. Preferably newer than or equal to `5.0`.

```
brew install zsh zsh-completions
```

#### Ubuntu, Debian & derivatives

```
sudo apt install zsh
```

#### Set up zsh as default (Optional)

```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

#### Basic Installation

Oh My Zsh is installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the command-line with either `curl` or `wget`.

##### via curl

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

##### via wget

```shell
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

### Using Oh My Zsh

#### Plugins

Oh My Zsh comes with a shitload of plugins to take advantage of. You can take a look in the [plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins) directory and/or the [wiki](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins) to see what's currently available.

#### Enabling Plugins

Once you spot a plugin (or several) that you'd like to use with Oh My Zsh, you'll need to enable them in the `.zshrc` file. You'll find the zshrc file in your `$HOME` directory. Open it with your favorite text editor and you'll see a spot to list all the plugins you want to load.

```shell
vi ~/.zshrc
```

For example, this might begin to look like this:

```shell
plugins=(
  git
  bundler
  dotenv
  osx
  rake
  rbenv
  ruby
)
```

#### Using Plugins

Most plugins (should! we're working on this) include a __README__, which documents how to use them.

### Themes

_Robby's theme is the default one. It's not the fanciest one. It's not the simplest one. It's just the right one (for him)._

Once you find a theme that you'd like to use, you will need to edit the `~/.zshrc` file. You'll see an environment variable (all caps) in there that looks like:

```shell
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
```

To use a different theme, simply change the value to match the name of your desired theme. For example:

```shell
ZSH_THEME="agnoster" # (this is one of the fancy ones)
# see https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster
```

_Note: many themes require installing the [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) in order to render properly._

Open up a new terminal window and your prompt should look something like this:

![Agnoster theme](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/6316862/70f58fb6-ba03-11e4-82c9-c083bf9a6574.png)

In case you did not find a suitable theme for your needs, please have a look at the wiki for [more of them](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/External-themes).

To use the `agnoster` theme in Microsoft Visual Studio Code, please add the following font to `User Settings`:

```
"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline, Book"
```

### Advanced Topics

#### Installation Problems

If you have any hiccups installing, here are a few common fixes.

* You _might_ need to modify your `PATH` in `~/.zshrc` if you're not able to find some commands after switching to `oh-my-zsh`.
* If you installed manually or changed the install location, check the `ZSH` environment variable in `~/.zshrc`.

#### Custom Plugins and Themes

If you want to override any of the default behaviors, just add a new file (ending in `.zsh`) in the `custom/` directory.

If you have many functions that go well together, you can put them as a `XYZ.plugin.zsh` file in the `custom/plugins/` directory and then enable this plugin.

If you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with Oh My Zsh, create a plugin of the same name in the `custom/plugins/` directory and it will be loaded instead of the one in `plugins/`.

### Getting Updates

By default, you will be prompted to check for upgrades every few weeks. If you would like `oh-my-zsh` to automatically upgrade itself without prompting you, set the following in your `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
DISABLE_UPDATE_PROMPT=true
```

To disable automatic upgrades, set the following in your `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true
```

### Manual Updates

If you'd like to upgrade at any point in time (maybe someone just released a new plugin and you don't want to wait a week?) you just need to run:

```shell
upgrade_oh_my_zsh
```

Magic! ðŸŽ‰

### Uninstalling Oh My Zsh

Oh My Zsh isn't for everyone. We'll miss you, but we want to make this an easy breakup.

If you want to uninstall `oh-my-zsh`, just run `uninstall_oh_my_zsh` from the command-line. It will remove itself and revert your previous `bash` or `zsh` configuration.
