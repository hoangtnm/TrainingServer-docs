# Install OpenBlas in Ubuntu 18.04


### Dependencies

Building OpenBLAS requires the following to be installed:

* GNU Make
* A C compiler, e.g. GCC or Clang
* A Fortran compiler (optional, for LAPACK)
* IBM MASS (optional, see below)


## Clone the OpenBLAS repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS.git
cd OpenBLAS
```

### Normal compile

```
make -j`nproc`
```

Simply invoking `make` (or `gmake` on BSD) will detect the CPU automatically.
To set a specific target CPU, use `make TARGET=xxx`, e.g. `make TARGET=NEHALEM`.
The full target list is in the file `TargetList.txt`.

### Debug version

A debug version can be built using `make DEBUG=1`.

### Install to a specific directory (optional)

Use `PREFIX=` when invoking `make`, for example

```sh
make install PREFIX=your_installation_directory
```

The default installation directory is `/opt/OpenBLAS`.

## Supported CPUs and Operating Systems

Please read `GotoBLAS_01Readme.txt`.

## Usage

Statically link with `libopenblas.a` or dynamically link with `-lopenblas` if OpenBLAS was
compiled as a shared library.

### Setting the number of threads using environment variables

Environment variables are used to specify a maximum number of threads.
For example,

```sh
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=4
export GOTO_NUM_THREADS=4
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
```

The priorities are `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` > `GOTO_NUM_THREADS` > `OMP_NUM_THREADS`.

If you compile this library with `USE_OPENMP=1`, you should set the `OMP_NUM_THREADS`
environment variable; OpenBLAS ignores `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` and `GOTO_NUM_THREADS` when
compiled with `USE_OPENMP=1`.

### Setting the number of threads at runtime

We provide the following functions to control the number of threads at runtime:

```c
void goto_set_num_threads(int num_threads);
void openblas_set_num_threads(int num_threads);
```

If you compile this library with `USE_OPENMP=1`, you should use the above functions too.
