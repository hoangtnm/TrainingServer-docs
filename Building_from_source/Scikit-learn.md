# Build Scikit-learn from source

###  Prerequisites

- Python (>= 2.7 or >= 3.4)

- NumPy (>= 1.8.2)

- SciPy (>= 0.13.3)

- pandas

- Cython >=0.23

### Clone the Scikit-learn repository

```
export SKLEARN=/home/$USER/workspace/prebuilt_libraries/numpy
git clone git://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git $SKLEARN
```

If you want to build a stable version, you can git checkout <VERSION> to get the code for that particular version

If you run the development version, it is cumbersome to reinstall the package each time you update the sources.

Therefore itâ€™s recommended that you install in editable, which allows you to edit the code in-place.

This builds the extension in place and creates a link to the development directory

```
pip install --editable .
```
