# Run a Remote Desktop on Raspberry Pi with VNC

### What Is VNC?

VNC uses the remote frame buffer protocol to give you control of another computer:

- transmitting keyboard and mouse input to the remote computer

- sending output back across the network to your display.

This means that you can launch programs remotely on your Raspberry Pi, adjust settings in the Raspbian GUI and generally use the desktop environment much as you would with the Pi plugged into your monitor.
